                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi. I'd like to introduce myself. I'm David Kansuzyan. I'm originally from Russia, Moscow and I moved to
                    USA 4 years ago. I've been struggling with setting up my goals until I found a path that made me excited
                    and hopeful for my future. Now, I'm making this portfolio as a student of Thinkful and looking forward for
                    a bright future as a software developer.</p>

            <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
              <p> Since I moved to America my life changed significantly. My language was poor at the time,but in four months I was able
                 to enroll at the local college (Jefferson Community and Technical College). I washoping to finish college and go to University
                 of Louisville after that and actually, I was thinking about pharmaceutical field, only after a couple of years at college that
                 thought was fading away as my desire to even graduate it. I wasn't really interested in any of those things. Eventually,
                 I decided to quit college and started to think about things that really gonna be interesting for me.</p>

              <p> I believe I found something that makes me excited and interested in. I found a new language(coding language) and as an English
                 language, I believe it will open new, much brighter doors before me and give me new great oppertunities. I'd like to meet new
                 experienced people in programming and work with them on different projects, so I could keep learning from them and grow as a
                 developer and as a person.</p>

            <p>Services that I want to provide:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Design websites</li>
                <li>Create and design new apps</li>
                <li>Develop new featers for websites and apps</li>
              </ol>

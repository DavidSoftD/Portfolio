            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>I'd lived in Russia for 25 years and been struggling with my life there. One day I won a Green card and my life changed significantly. I didn't know English language at all and as
               I was learning it I felt the opportunities showing up right in front of me. After couple of months I was able to go to college and study in foreign language, I found a job (it wasn't the dream job,but it was just a start).
               Now, after four years living in America I've decided to quit college and find a new way to learn new language (coding language) and as an English language, I believe it will open new, much brighter doors before me
               and give me new great oppertunities.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working or studying, I like to spend time with my family and friends or play video games. Also, I like sports a lot and if you have a soccer team, just find me I'll be a good inhancement.:) </p>
